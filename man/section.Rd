\title{Generate a Table of Section Positions}
\usage{
section(L, L.asym, k, Time = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{L}{numeric; the starting length of the sample}

\item{L.asym}{numeric; asymptotic length}

\item{k}{numeric; growth coefficient, calculate using the function k}

\item{Time}{numeric; period of growth to be represented by each section. Default is 1 day.}
}
\value{
The table returned are all the sections represented by 1 day time periods by default
}
\description{
\code{section} uses the LP1 function to generate a tibble of all the sections lengths representing 1 day of growth.
}
\examples{
section(L = 140, L.asym = 150, k = 0.0126) # uses the default time period of 1 day
section(L = 140, L.asym = 150, k = 0.0126, Time = 7) # specifying Time = 7 creates a table with sample sections representing 7 days
}
